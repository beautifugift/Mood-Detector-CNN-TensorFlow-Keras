# The Data
The data for this project was sourced from Google Photos, consisting of images capturing both smiling and non-smiling facial expressions. These photos served as the training data for the emotion detection model.

# About the Dataset
This dataset is centered on human facial expressions, focusing on two key emotions: happiness and sadness. It includes images of faces with clear visual markers of these emotional states. Using computer vision techniques, the system analyzes facial features to detect and classify emotions.

# The Objective
The goal is to build a computer vision model that accurately distinguishes between happy and sad facial expressions. By identifying the facial features associated with each emotion, the system provides insights into human emotional states through visual recognition, which could have broader applications in fields like healthcare, customer service, and social interaction analysis.

# **Data Gathering:**

- **Image Selection:** We curated images from Google Photos that clearly represented different moods, aiming for a balanced dataset with both happy and contrasting emotions. 

- **Labeling:** Each image was labeled as "Happy" or "Not Happy" to help the neural network link specific image features to these moods.

# **Training the Neural Network:**

- **Software:** We used TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the neural network due to their ease of use for image recognition.

- **Network Architecture:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were explored, as they excel at analyzing images and automatically extracting relevant features.

- **Training Process:** The CNN iteratively learned by adjusting its parameters with each labeled image, improving its ability to distinguish between happy and non-happy expressions.
